                    'whether she practiced monogamy and had ever slept with '
                    'older men. She also recounted that Mr. Cuomo told her '

                    'said. “And was wondering how I was going to get out of it '
                    'and assumed it was the end of my job.”With his '

                    'outrage at the allegations, amid a growing sense that Mr. '
                    'Cuomo, long a master of New York’s hardball politics, was '
                    'in a precarious position. Some called for an impeachment '
                    'hearing and others pressed for his resignation.The '
                    'criticism reached all the way to the White House, where '
                    'Jen Psaki, the press secretary for President Biden, a '
                    'longtime ally of Mr. Cuomo’s, said the president endorses '
                    'an investigation into allegations she described as '
                    '“serious.”“It was hard to read that story, as a woman,” '
                    'Ms. Psaki said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”Mr. Cuomo '
                    'seemed to immediately realize the potential damage, '
                    'asking on Saturday night for “all New Yorkers to await '
                    'the findings of the review so that they know the facts '
                    'before making any judgments.”The allegations about Mr. '
                    'Cuomo’s behavior toward women only compounded his recent '
                    'political problems, which include  into his '
                    'administration’s purposeful undercount of '
                    'coronavirus-related deaths of nursing home residents.But '
                    'the harassment accusations could prove even more damaging '
                    'for a governor who has prided himself on advancing '
                    'protections for  and  the elevation of Brett Kavanaugh to '
                    'the U.S. Supreme Court as a blow to women’s rights.“There '
                    'are serious questions about his ability to retain his '
                    'power,” said Kenneth Sherrill, a professor of political '
                    'science at Hunter College.The governor’s attempts to '
                    'control the narrative and the course of the '
                    'investigations quickly ran aground, as he was forced to '
                    'retreat from a plan to have Ms. Bennett’s claims '
                    'investigated by Barbara S. Jones, a former federal judge '
                    'who has close ties to Mr. Cuomo’s former top aide.The '
                    'sputtering efforts to establish an investigation came '
                    'even as outrage over Ms. Bennett’s claims suffused social '
                    'media and network news, recasting Mr. Cuomo — once '
                    'considered a heroic figure in the state and national '
                    'fight against the coronavirus — as a villain.Mayor Bill '
                    'de Blasio, long the target of Mr. Cuomo’s attacks, issued '
                    'a lengthy statement lamenting and chronicling the '
                    'governor’s recent failures, including “detailed, '
                    'documented accounts of sexual harassment, multiple '
                    'instances of intimidation and the admitted withholding of '
                    'information on the deaths of over 15,000 people.”Indeed, '
                    'Mr. Cuomo’s brusque and sometimes abrasive approach '
                    'toward fellow Democrats had left him with few defenders '
                    'on Sunday, even as longtime foils sharpened their '
                    'rhetoric.State Senator Alessandra Biaggi, a frequent '
                    'critic of the governor, called on him to resign. “You are '
                    'a monster, and it is time for you to go,” on Twitter. '
                    '“Now.”Her call for resignation was still something of an '
                    'outlier in the Democrat-controlled Legislature, though '
                    'the leaders of both chambers had called for independent '
                    'investigations of Mr. Cuomo.A smattering of officials '
                    'have urged the Legislature to impeach the governor — '
                    'echoing a sentiment found on a billboard near the Capitol '
                    'that simply read, “Impeach!”Still, that option seems '
                    'unlikely. The last New York governor to have been '
                    'impeached was Gov. William Sulzer, , according to '
                    'Roderick Hills, an N.Y.U. law professor.There are also '
                    'few parameters in the State Constitution defining '
                    'impeachable conduct.“There’s no standard for impeachment '
                    'really in New York,” said Eric Lane, a professor of '
                    'public law at Hofstra University and a former counsel to '
                    'the Senate Democrats. “There’s a very vague '
                    'statute.”Should a majority of Assembly members vote to '
                    'impeach the governor, the State Senate would conduct the '
                    'trial. senators and members of the Court of Appeals, the '
                    'state’s highest court. Judge DiFiore is the chief judge '
                    'on that court, which may have complicated her role in any '
                    'investigation.A more likely scenario would involve '
                    'lawmakers using this recent spate of scandals to reclaim '
                    'the unilateral emergency powers they had granted the '
                    'governor at the start of the pandemic. Those efforts had '
                    'been seemingly slowed last week, as the State Assembly '
                    'could not reach a consensus on  to strip Mr. Cuomo of '
                    'those powers. Now, however, such a move could be more '
                    'likely.But Ms. Bennett’s testimonial also seemed to touch '
                    'a deeper nerve, particularly in Albany, which has a long '
                    'and sordid history of sexual harassment and misconduct.In '
                    'the wake of the #MeToo movement, Mr. Cuomo  establishing '
                    'a range of workplace new protections,  he wanted to '
                    '“honor all the women” who have suffered pain and '
                    'humiliation as a result of harassment.“Let’s honor the '
                    'women who have had the courage to come forward and tell '
                    'their story,” he said . In Mr. Cuomo’s statement on '
                    'Sunday, he urged people not to contact Ms. Bennett to '
                    '“express displeasure about her coming forward.”Ms. '
                    'Bennett’s disclosures came a few days after Lindsey '
                    'Boylan, a former state economic development official,  '
                    'that Mr. Cuomo had harassed her on several occasions . '
                    'She accused the governor of giving her at one point an '
                    'unsolicited kiss on the lips at his Manhattan office. Mr. '
                    'Cuomo has denied the claims.Erica Vladimer, a co-founder '
                    'of the Sexual Harassment Working Group, a collective of '
                    'former state workers, said the governor should resign, '
                    'noting that the separate accusations of the governor’s '
                    'bullying tendencies fit the same theme.“It’s not two '
                    'separate sets of allegations,” she said. “It is two '
                    'examples of longstanding abuse, harassment, retaliation '
                    'and the culture of a hostile work environment.”Luke '

 'article_content': 'ALBANY, N.Y. — Gov.  on Sunday sought to stem the growing '
                    'political fallout over fresh allegations of sexual '
                    'harassment, acknowledging that he may have made '
                    'inappropriate remarks that could “have been '
                    'misinterpreted as an unwanted flirtation” to a young '
                    'female aide during private meetings last spring.Mr. '
                    'Cuomo, 63, said his comments — including those which '
                    'emerged  from the aide, Charlotte Bennett — were an '
                    'extension of life spent at work, where he sometimes '
                    '“teased people about their personal lives and '
                    'relationships.”“I now understand that my interactions may '
                    'have been insensitive or too personal and that some of my '
                    'comments, given my position, made others feel in ways I '
                    'never intended,” Mr. Cuomo said . “I acknowledge some of '
                    'the things I have said have been misinterpreted as an '
                    'unwanted flirtation. To the extent anyone felt that way, '
                    'I am truly sorry about that.”The response from the '
                    'governor seemed to reflect the gravity of Ms. Bennett’s '
                    'accusations, and those of another former aide last week, '
                    'as well as the potential damage that they could cause to '
                    'Mr. Cuomo, a third-term Democrat.Mr. Cuomo, who emerged '
                    'as a national leader during the pandemic, also repeated '
                    'his calls for an independent investigation of his own '
                    'behavior, though the decision over who would oversee that '
                    'inquiry has already proved torturous. His initial choice '
                    'of a former federal judge to lead the investigation was '
                    'met with overwhelming criticism, as was his second '
                    'suggestion that Letitia James, New York’s attorney '
                    'general, be paired with Janet DiFiore, the chief judge on '
                    'New York State’s highest court, to jointly pick someone '
                    'to investigate the matter. Ms. James rejected that '
                    'proposal.Finally, late Sunday, Mr. Cuomo relented again, '
                    'saying in a statement that he would grant subpoena power '
                    'to whomever Ms. James designated as the outside '
                    'investigator, as Ms. James had demanded.In a series of '
                    'interviews with  last week, Ms. Bennett said Mr. Cuomo '
                    'had asked her about elements of her sex life, including '
                    'whether she practiced monogamy and had ever slept with '
                    'older men. She also recounted that Mr. Cuomo told her '
                    'that he was open to dating women in their 20s and spoke '
                    'to her in discomfiting ways about her own experience with '
                    'sexual assault.She said she believed the governor — who '
                    'also complained of being lonely and wanting a girlfriend '
                    'in Albany — was making sexual overtures toward her.“I '
                    'understood that the governor wanted to sleep with me, and '
                    'felt horribly uncomfortable and scared,” Ms. Bennett, 25, '
                    'said. “And was wondering how I was going to get out of it '
                    'and assumed it was the end of my job.”With his '
                    'administration reeling, Mr. Cuomo sought once again to '
                    'explain his comments, saying “questions have been raised '
                    'about some of my past interactions with people in the '
                    'office.”Mr. Cuomo said that he “never intended to offend '
                    'anyone or cause any harm” and insisted that he “never '
                    'inappropriately touched” or propositioned anyone. Ms. '
                    'Bennett did not accuse the governor of touching her.“I '
                    'never intended to make anyone feel uncomfortable,” he '
                    'said.Despite the governor’s explanation, a chorus of '
                    'fellow Democrats have called for investigations, '
                    'including Senators Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand '
                    'and progressive stars like Representative Alexandria '
                    'Ocasio-Cortez.Politicians from both parties expressed '
                    'outrage at the allegations, amid a growing sense that Mr. '
                    'Cuomo, long a master of New York’s hardball politics, was '
                    'in a precarious position. Some called for an impeachment '
                    'hearing and others pressed for his resignation.The '
                    'criticism reached all the way to the White House, where '
                    'Jen Psaki, the press secretary for President Biden, a '
                    'longtime ally of Mr. Cuomo’s, said the president endorses '
                    'an investigation into allegations she described as '
                    '“serious.”“It was hard to read that story, as a woman,” '

 'article_content': 'ALBANY, N.Y. — Gov.  on Sunday sought to stem the growing '
                    'political fallout over fresh allegations of sexual '
                    'harassment, acknowledging that he may have made '
                    'inappropriate remarks that could “have been '
                    'misinterpreted as an unwanted flirtation” to a young '
                    'female aide during private meetings last spring.Mr. '
                    'Cuomo, 63, said his comments — including those which '
                    'emerged  from the aide, Charlotte Bennett — were an '
                    'extension of life spent at work, where he sometimes '
                    '“teased people about their personal lives and '
                    'relationships.”“I now understand that my interactions may '
                    'have been insensitive or too personal and that some of my '
                    'comments, given my position, made others feel in ways I '
                    'never intended,” Mr. Cuomo said . “I acknowledge some of '
                    'the things I have said have been misinterpreted as an '
                    'unwanted flirtation. To the extent anyone felt that way, '
                    'I am truly sorry about that.”The response from the '
                    'governor seemed to reflect the gravity of Ms. Bennett’s '
                    'accusations, and those of another former aide last week, '
                    'as well as the potential damage that they could cause to '
                    'Mr. Cuomo, a third-term Democrat.Mr. Cuomo, who emerged '
                    'as a national leader during the pandemic, also repeated '
                    'his calls for an independent investigation of his own '
                    'behavior, though the decision over who would oversee that '
                    'inquiry has already proved torturous. His initial choice '
                    'of a former federal judge to lead the investigation was '
                    'met with overwhelming criticism, as was his second '
                    'suggestion that Letitia James, New York’s attorney '
                    'general, be paired with Janet DiFiore, the chief judge on '
                    'New York State’s highest court, to jointly pick someone '
                    'to investigate the matter. Ms. James rejected that '
                    'proposal.Finally, late Sunday, Mr. Cuomo relented again, '
                    'saying in a statement that he would grant subpoena power '
                    'to whomever Ms. James designated as the outside '
                    'investigator, as Ms. James had demanded.In a series of '
                    'interviews with  last week, Ms. Bennett said Mr. Cuomo '
                    'had asked her about elements of her sex life, including '
                    'whether she practiced monogamy and had ever slept with '
                    'older men. She also recounted that Mr. Cuomo told her '
                    'that he was open to dating women in their 20s and spoke '
                    'to her in discomfiting ways about her own experience with '
                    'sexual assault.She said she believed the governor — who '
                    'also complained of being lonely and wanting a girlfriend '
                    'in Albany — was making sexual overtures toward her.“I '
                    'understood that the governor wanted to sleep with me, and '
                    'felt horribly uncomfortable and scared,” Ms. Bennett, 25, '
                    'said. “And was wondering how I was going to get out of it '
                    'and assumed it was the end of my job.”With his '
                    'administration reeling, Mr. Cuomo sought once again to '
                    'explain his comments, saying “questions have been raised '
                    'about some of my past interactions with people in the '
                    'office.”Mr. Cuomo said that he “never intended to offend '
                    'anyone or cause any harm” and insisted that he “never '
                    'inappropriately touched” or propositioned anyone. Ms. '
                    'Bennett did not accuse the governor of touching her.“I '
                    'never intended to make anyone feel uncomfortable,” he '
                    'said.Despite the governor’s explanation, a chorus of '
                    'fellow Democrats have called for investigations, '
                    'including Senators Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand '
                    'and progressive stars like Representative Alexandria '
                    'Ocasio-Cortez.Politicians from both parties expressed '
                    'outrage at the allegations, amid a growing sense that Mr. '
                    'Cuomo, long a master of New York’s hardball politics, was '
                    'in a precarious position. Some called for an impeachment '
                    'hearing and others pressed for his resignation.The '
                    'criticism reached all the way to the White House, where '
                    'Jen Psaki, the press secretary for President Biden, a '
                    'longtime ally of Mr. Cuomo’s, said the president endorses '
                    'an investigation into allegations she described as '
                    '“serious.”“It was hard to read that story, as a woman,” '
                    'Ms. Psaki said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”Mr. Cuomo '
                    'seemed to immediately realize the potential damage, '
                    'asking on Saturday night for “all New Yorkers to await '
                    'the findings of the review so that they know the facts '
                    'before making any judgments.”The allegations about Mr. '
                    'Cuomo’s behavior toward women only compounded his recent '
                    'political problems, which include  into his '
                    'administration’s purposeful undercount of '
                    'coronavirus-related deaths of nursing home residents.But '
                    'the harassment accusations could prove even more damaging '
                    'for a governor who has prided himself on advancing '
                    'protections for  and  the elevation of Brett Kavanaugh to '
                    'the U.S. Supreme Court as a blow to women’s rights.“There '
                    'are serious questions about his ability to retain his '
                    'power,” said Kenneth Sherrill, a professor of political '
                    'science at Hunter College.The governor’s attempts to '
                    'control the narrative and the course of the '
                    'investigations quickly ran aground, as he was forced to '
                    'retreat from a plan to have Ms. Bennett’s claims '
                    'investigated by Barbara S. Jones, a former federal judge '
                    'who has close ties to Mr. Cuomo’s former top aide.The '
                    'sputtering efforts to establish an investigation came '
                    'even as outrage over Ms. Bennett’s claims suffused social '
                    'media and network news, recasting Mr. Cuomo — once '
                    'considered a heroic figure in the state and national '
                    'fight against the coronavirus — as a villain.Mayor Bill '
                    'de Blasio, long the target of Mr. Cuomo’s attacks, issued '
                    'a lengthy statement lamenting and chronicling the '
                    'governor’s recent failures, including “detailed, '
                    'documented accounts of sexual harassment, multiple '
                    'instances of intimidation and the admitted withholding of '
                    'information on the deaths of over 15,000 people.”Indeed, '
                    'Mr. Cuomo’s brusque and sometimes abrasive approach '
                    'toward fellow Democrats had left him with few defenders '
                    'on Sunday, even as longtime foils sharpened their '
                    'rhetoric.State Senator Alessandra Biaggi, a frequent '
                    'critic of the governor, called on him to resign. “You are '
                    'a monster, and it is time for you to go,” on Twitter. '
                    '“Now.”Her call for resignation was still something of an '
                    'outlier in the Democrat-controlled Legislature, though '
                    'the leaders of both chambers had called for independent '
                    'investigations of Mr. Cuomo.A smattering of officials '
                    'have urged the Legislature to impeach the governor — '
                    'echoing a sentiment found on a billboard near the Capitol '
                    'that simply read, “Impeach!”Still, that option seems '
                    'unlikely. The last New York governor to have been '
                    'impeached was Gov. William Sulzer, , according to '
                    'Roderick Hills, an N.Y.U. law professor.There are also '
                    'few parameters in the State Constitution defining '
                    'impeachable conduct.“There’s no standard for impeachment '
                    'really in New York,” said Eric Lane, a professor of '
                    'public law at Hofstra University and a former counsel to '
                    'the Senate Democrats. “There’s a very vague '
                    'statute.”Should a majority of Assembly members vote to '
                    'impeach the governor, the State Senate would conduct the '
                    'trial. senators and members of the Court of Appeals, the '
                    'state’s highest court. Judge DiFiore is the chief judge '
                    'on that court, which may have complicated her role in any '
                    'investigation.A more likely scenario would involve '
                    'lawmakers using this recent spate of scandals to reclaim '
                    'the unilateral emergency powers they had granted the '
                    'governor at the start of the pandemic. Those efforts had '
                    'been seemingly slowed last week, as the State Assembly '
                    'could not reach a consensus on  to strip Mr. Cuomo of '
                    'those powers. Now, however, such a move could be more '
                    'likely.But Ms. Bennett’s testimonial also seemed to touch '
                    'a deeper nerve, particularly in Albany, which has a long '
                    'and sordid history of sexual harassment and misconduct.In '

 'article_content': 'ALBANY, N.Y. — Gov.  on Sunday sought to stem the growing '
                    'political fallout over fresh allegations of sexual '
                    'harassment, acknowledging that he may have made '
                    'inappropriate remarks that could “have been '
                    'misinterpreted as an unwanted flirtation” to a young '
                    'female aide during private meetings last spring.Mr. '
                    'Cuomo, 63, said his comments — including those which '
                    'emerged  from the aide, Charlotte Bennett — were an '
                    'extension of life spent at work, where he sometimes '
                    '“teased people about their personal lives and '
                    'relationships.”“I now understand that my interactions may '
                    'have been insensitive or too personal and that some of my '
                    'comments, given my position, made others feel in ways I '
                    'never intended,” Mr. Cuomo said . “I acknowledge some of '
                    'the things I have said have been misinterpreted as an '
                    'unwanted flirtation. To the extent anyone felt that way, '
                    'I am truly sorry about that.”The response from the '
                    'governor seemed to reflect the gravity of Ms. Bennett’s '
                    'accusations, and those of another former aide last week, '
                    'as well as the potential damage that they could cause to '
                    'Mr. Cuomo, a third-term Democrat.Mr. Cuomo, who emerged '
                    'as a national leader during the pandemic, also repeated '
                    'his calls for an independent investigation of his own '
                    'behavior, though the decision over who would oversee that '
                    'inquiry has already proved torturous. His initial choice '
                    'of a former federal judge to lead the investigation was '
                    'met with overwhelming criticism, as was his second '
                    'suggestion that Letitia James, New York’s attorney '
                    'general, be paired with Janet DiFiore, the chief judge on '
                    'New York State’s highest court, to jointly pick someone '
                    'to investigate the matter. Ms. James rejected that '
                    'proposal.Finally, late Sunday, Mr. Cuomo relented again, '
                    'saying in a statement that he would grant subpoena power '
                    'to whomever Ms. James designated as the outside '
                    'investigator, as Ms. James had demanded.In a series of '
                    'interviews with  last week, Ms. Bennett said Mr. Cuomo '
                    'had asked her about elements of her sex life, including '
                    'whether she practiced monogamy and had ever slept with '
                    'older men. She also recounted that Mr. Cuomo told her '
                    'that he was open to dating women in their 20s and spoke '
                    'to her in discomfiting ways about her own experience with '
                    'sexual assault.She said she believed the governor — who '
                    'also complained of being lonely and wanting a girlfriend '
                    'in Albany — was making sexual overtures toward her.“I '
                    'understood that the governor wanted to sleep with me, and '
                    'felt horribly uncomfortable and scared,” Ms. Bennett, 25, '
                    'said. “And was wondering how I was going to get out of it '
                    'and assumed it was the end of my job.”With his '
                    'administration reeling, Mr. Cuomo sought once again to '
                    'explain his comments, saying “questions have been raised '
                    'about some of my past interactions with people in the '
                    'office.”Mr. Cuomo said that he “never intended to offend '
                    'anyone or cause any harm” and insisted that he “never '
                    'inappropriately touched” or propositioned anyone. Ms. '
                    'Bennett did not accuse the governor of touching her.“I '
                    'never intended to make anyone feel uncomfortable,” he '
                    'said.Despite the governor’s explanation, a chorus of '
                    'fellow Democrats have called for investigations, '
                    'including Senators Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand '
                    'and progressive stars like Representative Alexandria '
                    'Ocasio-Cortez.Politicians from both parties expressed '
                    'outrage at the allegations, amid a growing sense that Mr. '
                    'Cuomo, long a master of New York’s hardball politics, was '
                    'in a precarious position. Some called for an impeachment '
                    'hearing and others pressed for his resignation.The '
                    'criticism reached all the way to the White House, where '
                    'Jen Psaki, the press secretary for President Biden, a '
                    'longtime ally of Mr. Cuomo’s, said the president endorses '
                    'an investigation into allegations she described as '
                    '“serious.”“It was hard to read that story, as a woman,” '
                    'Ms. Psaki said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”Mr. Cuomo '
                    'seemed to immediately realize the potential damage, '
                    'asking on Saturday night for “all New Yorkers to await '
                    'the findings of the review so that they know the facts '
                    'before making any judgments.”The allegations about Mr. '
                    'Cuomo’s behavior toward women only compounded his recent '
                    'political problems, which include  into his '
                    'administration’s purposeful undercount of '
                    'coronavirus-related deaths of nursing home residents.But '
                    'the harassment accusations could prove even more damaging '
                    'for a governor who has prided himself on advancing '
                    'protections for  and  the elevation of Brett Kavanaugh to '
                    'the U.S. Supreme Court as a blow to women’s rights.“There '
                    'are serious questions about his ability to retain his '
                    'power,” said Kenneth Sherrill, a professor of political '
                    'science at Hunter College.The governor’s attempts to '
                    'control the narrative and the course of the '
                    'investigations quickly ran aground, as he was forced to '
                    'retreat from a plan to have Ms. Bennett’s claims '
                    'investigated by Barbara S. Jones, a former federal judge '
                    'who has close ties to Mr. Cuomo’s former top aide.The '
                    'sputtering efforts to establish an investigation came '
                    'even as outrage over Ms. Bennett’s claims suffused social '
                    'media and network news, recasting Mr. Cuomo — once '
                    'considered a heroic figure in the state and national '
                    'fight against the coronavirus — as a villain.Mayor Bill '
                    'de Blasio, long the target of Mr. Cuomo’s attacks, issued '
                    'a lengthy statement lamenting and chronicling the '
                    'governor’s recent failures, including “detailed, '
                    'documented accounts of sexual harassment, multiple '
                    'instances of intimidation and the admitted withholding of '
                    'information on the deaths of over 15,000 people.”Indeed, '
                    'Mr. Cuomo’s brusque and sometimes abrasive approach '
                    'toward fellow Democrats had left him with few defenders '
                    'on Sunday, even as longtime foils sharpened their '
                    'rhetoric.State Senator Alessandra Biaggi, a frequent '
                    'critic of the governor, called on him to resign. “You are '
                    'a monster, and it is time for you to go,” on Twitter. '
                    '“Now.”Her call for resignation was still something of an '
                    'outlier in the Democrat-controlled Legislature, though '
                    'the leaders of both chambers had called for independent '
                    'investigations of Mr. Cuomo.A smattering of officials '
                    'have urged the Legislature to impeach the governor — '
                    'echoing a sentiment found on a billboard near the Capitol '
                    'that simply read, “Impeach!”Still, that option seems '
                    'unlikely. The last New York governor to have been '
                    'impeached was Gov. William Sulzer, , according to '
                    'Roderick Hills, an N.Y.U. law professor.There are also '
                    'few parameters in the State Constitution defining '
                    'impeachable conduct.“There’s no standard for impeachment '
                    'really in New York,” said Eric Lane, a professor of '
                    'public law at Hofstra University and a former counsel to '
                    'the Senate Democrats. “There’s a very vague '
                    'statute.”Should a majority of Assembly members vote to '
                    'impeach the governor, the State Senate would conduct the '
                    'trial. senators and members of the Court of Appeals, the '
                    'state’s highest court. Judge DiFiore is the chief judge '
                    'on that court, which may have complicated her role in any '
                    'investigation.A more likely scenario would involve '
                    'lawmakers using this recent spate of scandals to reclaim '
                    'the unilateral emergency powers they had granted the '
                    'governor at the start of the pandemic. Those efforts had '
                    'been seemingly slowed last week, as the State Assembly '
                    'could not reach a consensus on  to strip Mr. Cuomo of '
                    'those powers. Now, however, such a move could be more '
                    'likely.But Ms. Bennett’s testimonial also seemed to touch '
                    'a deeper nerve, particularly in Albany, which has a long '
                    'and sordid history of sexual harassment and misconduct.In '
                    'the wake of the #MeToo movement, Mr. Cuomo  establishing '
                    'a range of workplace new protections,  he wanted to '
                    '“honor all the women” who have suffered pain and '
                    'humiliation as a result of harassment.“Let’s honor the '
                    'women who have had the courage to come forward and tell '
                    'their story,” he said . In Mr. Cuomo’s statement on '
                    'Sunday, he urged people not to contact Ms. Bennett to '
                    '“express displeasure about her coming forward.”Ms. '
                    'Bennett’s disclosures came a few days after Lindsey '
                    'Boylan, a former state economic development official,  '
                    'that Mr. Cuomo had harassed her on several occasions . '
                    'She accused the governor of giving her at one point an '
                    'unsolicited kiss on the lips at his Manhattan office. Mr. '
                    'Cuomo has denied the claims.Erica Vladimer, a co-founder '
                    'of the Sexual Harassment Working Group, a collective of '
                    'former state workers, said the governor should resign, '
                    'noting that the separate accusations of the governor’s '
                    'bullying tendencies fit the same theme.“It’s not two '
                    'separate sets of allegations,” she said. “It is two '
                    'examples of longstanding abuse, harassment, retaliation '
                    'and the culture of a hostile work environment.”Luke '
